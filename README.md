# TRIUMF-DT-FUSION
Unfortunately a large portion of the code used in this coop is not available for the public and i cannot post however my supervisor at TRIUMF 
has given me permission to upload this one rmatrix code to show that i did infact use FORTAN at triumf and am capable of using it as a language
This Fortan code was used to develope a DT fusion model using Rmatrix methods for scattering of these nuclei
